# sequential_birch_stream

Uses the sequential version of Birch algorithm to cluster tweets.

# vectorize_stream_ms

Use the MeanShift algorithme on the tweet stream after the vectorization using sklearn - that we later improoved.

# vectorize_clustering

Vectorization than clustering of a predefined corps chosen so that we can guess its number of clusters.
